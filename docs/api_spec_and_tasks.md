## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point for the application. Initializes Flask app and SQLAlchemy."),
    ("models.py", "Defines the TestCase and User classes. Handles database interactions."),
    ("views.py", "Handles routing and HTTP requests. Depends on models.py."),
    ("tests.py", "Contains test cases for the application. Depends on models.py and views.py."),
    ("utils.py", "Contains utility functions used across the application. No dependencies."),
    ("templates/index.html", "The main page of the application. Depends on views.py."),
    ("templates/report.html", "The report page of the application. Depends on views.py."),
    ("templates/visualize.html", "The visualization page of the application. Depends on views.py."),
    ("static/css/main.css", "The main CSS file for the application. No dependencies."),
    ("static/js/main.js", "The main JavaScript file for the application. Depends on views.py.")
]
```

## Task list
```python

    "models.py",
    "utils.py",
    "views.py",

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'main.py' contains the main entry point for the application. It initializes the Flask app and SQLAlchemy.
'models.py' defines the TestCase and User classes and handles database interactions.
'utils.py' contains utility functions used across the application.
'templates/index.html', 'templates/report.html', and 'templates/visualize.html' are the main pages of the application.
'static/css/main.css' and 'static/js/main.js' contain the main styling and functionality for the application.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. However, we need to ensure that all team members are familiar with the Flask framework, SQLAlchemy, and the other third-party libraries we are using. We also need to decide on a testing strategy and ensure that all team members are familiar with Pytest.
